Notes:
**Using Poetry for package management**, so when you clone the repo into your VS code be sure to:
- run poetry shell in your terminal before running (I believe that's how, please confirm if it worked)
- In current version, you'll face errors, please help me fix them, the error codes are pretty explanatory, I'm just not as familiar with LangChain to know what to tinker with and where (maybe it's a versioning issue?)





To-do:
- ✅ Upload ice-breakers to AirTable for human review
- Optimize Qualifier Prompt
- ✅ Optimize token usage on email draft
- Before running the next step, check if the leads csv contains a Linkedin_profile_url. If it doesn't, skip next step. If it does, make linkedin_profile_url = df['linkedin_profile_url']
- ✅ Sync with GitHub (latest version accessible to everyone)
- Check "iteration / time limit" error on critic
- ✅ Check "John Doe" instead on Yann LeCun on email draft.
